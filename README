This is an EXPERIMENT. I intend to write some documentation, but for now,
just read the source, Luke. Start with test.dart (and don't forget to define
your correct path to testrepo on top of the file!).

Note that this DOESN'T work on stock Dart VM as it needs some custom patches
to the builtin library. You can get a DPM-enabled Dart VM at

  https://github.com/Ladicek/dart-vm-with-dpm

There are two branches: filesystem-mods, which contain the changes needed for
DPM to work, and dart+dpm, which builds on filesystem-mods and has the DPM
added right to the builtin library.
