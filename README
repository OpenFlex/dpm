This is an EXPERIMENT. I intend to write some documentation, but for now,
just read the source, Luke. Start with test.dart (and don't forget to define
your correct path to testrepo on top of the file!).

Note that this DOESN'T work on stock Dart VM as it needs some custom patches
to the dart:io library. You can get a DPM-enabled Dart VM at

  https://github.com/Ladicek/dartruntime

There are two branches: builtin-libs-mods, which contains the changes needed
for DPM to work, and dart-vm+dpm, which builds on builtin-libs-mods, contains
DPM right in the dart:io library and is able to resolve imports like this:

  #import('dpm:organization:name:version');

They can be shortened like this:

  #import('dpm:organization:name');
  #import('dpm:name:version');
  #import('dpm:name');
